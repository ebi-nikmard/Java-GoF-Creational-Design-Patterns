# Java-GoF-Creational-Design-Patterns
# Creational patterns:
  Deal with initializing and configuring classes and objects.
# Class:
  # Factory Method:
    Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.  
    Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
# Object:
  # Abstract Factory:
    Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete class.
  # Builder:
    Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can 
    create different representations.
  # Prototype:
    Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
  # Singleton:
    Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
